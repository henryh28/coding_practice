● How to run the application:
○ The command we should use installing your dependencies, e.g: npm
install, pip install -r requirements.txt. You can assume we already have your
programming language set up in our environment, as well as any common
package managers (npm, yarn, bundle, pip, etc)
○ The command we should use for actually running the application, e.g: npm
start, java Main, python manage.py serve
● A brief (three sentences) high-level description of your project, written for a
